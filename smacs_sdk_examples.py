In this example script, we will be be using the APIs to provision and then deprovision an end user with a DN on a 
specified site. We will also provision a deskphone and Single Number Reach if 1-Click provisioning is enabled for those
services on the selected site. (You can use the automation API to provision a user with any services as long as they 
have 1-click enabled.) In order to run this script the following parameters will need to be provided: 
"""

username = ''  # The username of the user you wish to provision.
dial_plan_group_name = ''  # The name of the dial plan group you wish to assign a DN from.
site_id = 0  # The id of the site they will be provisioned on.
mac_address = ''  # The MAC Address of the phone to be assigned to the user, if 1-Click provisioning is
# enabled for deskphones on the selected site. A dummy MAC Address can be provided as long as it is in a valid format.

"""
If you don't have the id for the site you wish to provision to, you can search for it using the site name, like so:

search_params = {"site_name": "Your site name"}
site_id = swagger_client.SitesApi().search_sites(**search_params)[0].id
