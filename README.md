### Examples of how to use Stack8 SDKs

Welcome to Stack8's smacs-sdk-examples repo, which currently contains our Python SDK as well as an example script written in Python 3.6 to show how it can be used to make managing your UC environment simpler and more efficient. 

In order to call the SMACS APIs a bit of configuration is necessary. The following properties will need to be set in the configuration.py file within the swagger_client folder before opening the script:

```
self.host = "url to your instance of SMACS/services"
self.username = "username for user with admin privileges"
self.password = "password for user with admin privileges"
```

Once these properties are set, you can install the required libraries (pip/pip3 install -r requirements.txt) and then open smacs_sdk_examples.py in your text editor of choice and follow the instructions provided for an example of how to automate the provisioning and deprovisioning of an End User. 

Feel free to contact customer support for any questions you may have regarding the use of our APIs, and thank you for the continued support!

### Note :
These examples were written against SMACS version 7.2.0 and come packaged with the appropriate SDK. As we are constantly making improvements to our web services we cannot guarantee that this script will be able to run against any later version of SMACS, and certainly won't run against anything prior to 6.8.1. 

To request a new version of these examples for your version of SMACS please contact customer support.
